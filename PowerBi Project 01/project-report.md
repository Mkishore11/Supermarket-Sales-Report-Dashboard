## DAX Formulas and Calculations

### Key Measures
```dax
Total Revenue = SUM(Sales[Total])

Total Gross Income = SUM(Sales[Gross Income])

Average Transaction Value = DIVIDE([Total Revenue], [Total Transactions])

Month-over-Month Growth = 
DIVIDE(
    [Total Revenue] - CALCULATE([Total Revenue], PREVIOUSMONTH(Sales[Date])),
    CALCULATE([Total Revenue], PREVIOUSMONTH(Sales[Date]))
)

YTD Revenue = TOTALYTD([Total Revenue], Sales[Date])

Top Product Line = 
TOPN(1, 
    SUMMARIZE(Sales, Sales[Product Line], "Revenue", [Total Revenue]),
    [Revenue],
    DESC
)
```

### Time Intelligence
```dax
Same Period Last Year = 
CALCULATE(
    [Total Revenue],
    SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR(Sales[Date])
)

Quarter to Date = TOTALQTD([Total Revenue], Sales[Date])

Rolling 3-Month Average = 
AVERAGEX(
    DATESINPERIOD(Sales[Date], LASTDATE(Sales[Date]), -3, MONTH),
    [Total Revenue]
)
```
